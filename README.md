# Nuclear Energy Project

I analysed data on nuclear energy generation and use since 1985 to identify trends in nuclear energy. I used a Kaggle dataset and cleaned the data in SQL (see data_cleaning.sql). I also did some exploratory data analysis in SQL (see eda.sql) before visualising the data in Power BI.

Skills and technologies used include: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualisation, SQL and Power BI.
